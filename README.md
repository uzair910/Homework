Setup Environment and Run the Project
=====================================

Step 1: Run Setup Script
Open a terminal or PowerShell in the root folder (make sure you have admin rights).
Execute the setup.sh script and wait for it to complete.
Once the setup script has finished successfully, all dependencies for the three projects (HOMEWORK.API, API.TESTS, and UI) will be installed.
Step 2: Run the Projects
To save time, you can run the run.sh script, which will:
Run unit tests
Deploy the backend API
Run the React app
Happy Reviewing! :)
