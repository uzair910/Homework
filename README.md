# Setup Environment and Run the Project

## Step 1: Run Setup Script

1. Open a terminal or PowerShell in the root folder (make sure you have admin rights).
2, Execute the setup.sh script and wait for it to complete.
3. Once the setup script has finished successfully, all dependencies for the three projects ('HOMEWORK.API', 'API.TESTS', and 'UI') will be installed.

## Step 2: Run the Projects
1. To save time, you can run the run.sh script, which will:
a. Run unit tests
b. Deploy the backend API
c. Run the React app



## Happy Reviewing! :)
